# LLM-Question-Parsing

This repository is part of my bachelor thesis and provides the code to test different LLMs with precompiled prompts.

The prompts are static and can be generated using prompt_builder.py

abstract_model.py traverses the prompts generated by the prompt builder and logs the result in a local csv file located at ../logs. In order to test a specific Model a specific implementation needs to be written, which inherits from AbstractModel and implements the send_prompt function.

Implementations for a few models are already provided in model_implementations using various APIs.

The specific models can be run using run_<model_name>.py using python 3.9 or greater
